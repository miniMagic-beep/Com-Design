# BPSK Communication System with GNU Radio and BladeRF

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)** communication system using **GNU Radio** and the **BladeRF SDR**. The system is capable of transmitting images between devices wirelessly with advanced features like Forward Error Correction (FEC), Checksum verification, and AES encryption to ensure secure and reliable data transmission.

## Features
- **Modulation**: BPSK modulation for efficient wireless communication.
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**: Built-in error-correcting codes for reliable data transfer.
- **Checksum**: Ensures data integrity by verifying that the transmitted data is received correctly.
- **AES Encryption**: Secure data encryption with AES before transmission to protect sensitive information.
- **Image Transmission**: Send images from one device to another wirelessly.
- **GNU Radio**: Utilizes the power of GNU Radio for digital signal processing and flow graph design.
- **BladeRF**: Supports BladeRF SDR for hardware-based transmission and reception.
